25 years and my life is still
Trying to get up that great big hill o hope
For a destination
I realized quickly when I knew I should
That the world’s never this brotherhood of man
For whatever that means
And so I cry sometimes when I’m lying in bed
Just to get it all out, what’s in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
What’s going on?
And I said
Hey-yeah-yeah-eh-eh
Hey-yeah-yeah
I said hey, what’s going on?
WHAT’S UP?
And I said
Hey-yeah-yeah-eh-eh
Hey-yeah-yeah
I said hey, what’s going on?
