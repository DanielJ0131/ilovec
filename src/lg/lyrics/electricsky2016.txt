Under the electric, the electric sky
We come together, together unite
Leave everything that you know behind
Everybody that is here tonight
We're here for the same reason, you and I
To meet underneath the electric sky
The electric sky 
(The electric sky)
Under the electric, the electric sky
Leave everything that you know behind
Everybody that is here tonight
The electric sky
(The electric sky)
The electric sky
Under the electric, the electric sky
We come together, together unite
Leave everything that you know behind
Everybody that is here tonight
We're here for the same reason, you and I
To meet underneath the electric sky
