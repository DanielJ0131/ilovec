I'm so jaded, can't you see?
Won't you come live in the past with me?
Everything is bad now anyway
Take me back to my old glory days
I'm so jaded, can't you see?
Won't you come live in the past with me?
Everything is bad now anyway
Take me back to my old glory days
I'm jaded AF
Jaded as fuck
Jaded as fuck
I'm so jaded, can't you see?
Won't you come live in the past with me?
Everything is bad now anyway
Take me back to my old glory days
I'm so jaded, can't you see?
Won't you come live in the past with me?
Everything is bad now anyway
Take me back to my old glory days
Yo, this party sucks dick
Things were so much better back when...
What about the music? It sucks
The DJs? They suck
The drugs? They suck
The people? They suck
Old school is king and that's final
Today's DJs can't even spin vinyl
The venue? It sucks
The stage? It sucks
The sound? It sucks
The lighting? It sucks
This ain't a rave, this is just a tease
"Best night of my life", bitch please
Now the only music that I find worthwhile
Is fidget-dub-progressive-up-tempo-free-style
It sucks
Can't you see? Can't you...
Can't you see? Can't you
Can't you see? Can't you...
Can't you see?
I'm so jaded, can't you see?
Won't you come live in the past with me?
Everything is bad now anyway
Take me back to my old glory days
I'm so jaded, can't you see?
Won't you come live in the past with me?
Everything is bad now anyway
Take me back to my old glory days
I'm so jaded
I'm so jaded
I'm so jaded
I'm so jaded
I'm so jaded
I'm so jaded
I'm so jaded (Jaded as fuck)
I'm so jaded
I'm so jaded
I'm so jaded
I'm so jaded
I'm so jaded
I'm so jaded
I'm so jaded
I'm so jaded
I'm so jaded
I'm so jaded
I'm so jaded
I'm so jaded
I'm so jaded
I'm so jaded
