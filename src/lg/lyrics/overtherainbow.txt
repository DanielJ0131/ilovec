Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
And the dreams that you dream of
Once in a lullaby
Someday I'll wish upon a star
Wake up where the clouds are far behind, me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
High above the chimney tops
That's where, you'll find me ohh
Somewhere over the rainbow ohh
Bluebirds fly
And the dreams that you dream of
Dreams really do come true
Over the rainbow!
Somewhere
Somewhere over the rainbow ohh
Bluebirds fly
And the dreams that you dream of
Once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
And the dreams that you dream of
Dreams really do come true
