Dok doki dok
Dok doki doki doki dok
Kiss me, kiss me
Do you really miss me?
When my heart goes doki doki
And the crowd is fucking cheering
Is it clear, like do you hear me?
Waku waku in my feelings
Got me bouncing off the ceiling
When you tell me that I'm pretty like
My heart goes
Dok doki dok dok
Doki doki doki dok dok
Doki dok dok
Doki doki doki dok dok
Doki dok doki dok doki dok
Doki doki doki doki doki
Doki doki dok
Kiss me, kiss me
Do you really miss me?
When my heart goes doki doki
And the crowd is fucking cheering
Is it clear, like do you hear me?
Waku waku in my feelings
Got me bouncing off the ceiling
When you tell me that I'm pretty like
I'm going iko ze, you know that I want it
I'm up in the corner and you're kabedon'ning
It's not my damn fault that I wanna jump on it
When you put your hands on my hips and I'm bouncing like
Kiss me, kiss me
Do you really miss me?
When my heart goes doki doki
And the crowd is fucking cheering
Is it clear, like do you hear me?
Waku waku in my feelings
Got me bouncing off the ceiling
Got me bounce bounce bounce
I'm going iko ze, you know that I want it
I'm up in the corner and you're kabedon'ning
It's not my damn fault that I wanna jump on it
When you put your hands on my hips and I'm bouncing like
My heart goes
Dok dok dok dok
