Predictable rave song
Rave song, rave song
Rave song
All night, moving to the music
Those eyes are lifting me higher
Oh-whoa-oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-whoa-oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
My mind when I see you dancing
Can't find a word to define you
Oh-whoa-oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-whoa-oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Hard bass in time with the music
Feels like I might just lose it
Then I realize that I'm inside
A predictable rave song
Oh, I've been stuck in a rave song
A predictable rave song
Oh, you make me feel like I'm
In a rave song, rave song, rave song, rave song
Predictable rave song
Rave song, rave song
Rave song
Won't you be my shooting star tonight
Oh, burn bright and light up the whole night
Oh-whoa-oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-whoa-oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Set me free and we can be together
Ecstasy, I want you forever
Oh-whoa-oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-whoa-oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Hard bass in time with the music
Feels like I might just lose it
Then I realize that I'm inside
A predictable rave song
Oh, I've been stuck in a rave song
Stuck in a rave song, all night long
Oh, you make me feel like I'm
In a rave song, rave song, rave song, rave song
Rave song, rave song, rave song, rave song
Rave song, rave song, rave song, rave song
...
A predictable rave song
Oh, I've been stuck in a rave song
A predictable rave song
Oh, you make me feel like I'm
In a rave song, rave song, rave song
Predictable rave song
Rave song, rave song
Rave song
Stuck in a rave song, all night long
Oh, you make me feel like I'm
In a rave song
