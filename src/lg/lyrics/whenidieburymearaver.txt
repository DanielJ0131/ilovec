When I take my dying breath
And slip into my final rest
I want you to
Bury me a raver
As I take eternal sleep
Don't pray for my soul to keep
I just want you
To bury me a raver
Die hard raver
Staring at the lazer
Stargazer
With the ill behaviour
DJ's cuttin' with a mother f*ckin razor
When I die
Bury me a raver
Die hard raver
Staring at the lazer
Stargazer
With the ill behaviour
DJ's cuttin' with a mother f*ckin razor
When I die
Bury me a raver
Bury me a raver
When I take my dying breath
And slip into my final rest
I want you to
Bury me a raver
As I take eternal sleep
Don't pray for my soul to keep
I just want you
To bury me a raver
I just want my family to know
I just want my family to know
Tomorrow's never promised
And in this world we live in today
You'll never know when that time's gonna come
So I just want my family to know
When that day comes
When that day comes
I want you to bury me a raver
Die hard raver
Staring at the lazer
Stargazer
With the ill behaviour
DJ's cuttin' with a mother f*ckin razor
When I die
Bury me a raver
Die hard raver
Staring at the lazer
Stargazer
With the ill behaviour
DJ's cuttin' with a mother f*ckin razor
When I die
Bury me a raver
When I take my dying breath
And slip into my final rest
I want you to
Bury me a raver
As I take eternal sleep
Don't pray for my soul to keep
I just want you
To bury me a raver
