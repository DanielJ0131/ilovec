I'm just like candy,
I can be sweet.
If you're a good boy,
I'll be your treat.
I'm just like candy,

If you're a good boy,
I'll be your treat.
It might be nice, but whatever you do,
Don't have too much, I'm no good for you.
Now unwrap me and you will see,
One little taste brings you to your knees.
It might be fun, but whatever you do,
Don't have too much, I'm no good for you.
No good for you, no-no good for you.
No good for you, no-no good for you.
I'm just like candy,
I can be sweet.
If you're a good boy,
I'll be your treat.
It might be nice, but whatever you do,
Don't have too much, I'm no good for you.
I'm no good for you.
Lick me, suck me, and bite me gently.
It doesn't matter if it gets a little messy.
I'll tell you when you can stop
Or when you can have more.
