I won't let you go
Won't let you go
Won't let you go
I won't let you go
They say it's forbidden
That life's not worth living
If you're not there right beside me
Even in the nether
We will stay together
Writing out our own destiny
In the darkness, in the light
You and I will be alright
I know, and so
I won't let you go
Either way we meet our end
I know I'll see you again
I know, and so
I won't let you go
Won't let you...
I won't let you go
Won't let you go
Won't let you go
Won't let you go
Won't let you go
I won't, let, you, go
If our dreams are shattered
Our wings ripped in tatters
We'll still find a way to soar
So come heaven or hell
No one will break this spell
Then we pass forevermore
Either way we meet our end
I know I'll see you again
I know, and so
I won't let you go
In the darkness, in the light
You and I will be alright
I know, and so
I won't let you go
Won't let you go
Won't let you go
Won't let you go
Won't let you go
Either way we meet our end
I know I'll see you again
I know, and so
I won't let you go
