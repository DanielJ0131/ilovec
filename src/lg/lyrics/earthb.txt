Fly into the sky
Past the moon and sun
Go right through the dome
Where the oceans run
I'd do anything to be with you
I would climb the wall
That surrounds us all
The horizon shows lack of curvature
Anything I can to be with you
Anything I can
To be with you
Pumpin!
Fly into the sky
Past the moon and sun
Go right through the dome
Where the oceans run
I'd do anything to be with you
I would climb the wall
That surrounds us all
The horizon shows lack of curvature
Anything I can to be with you
