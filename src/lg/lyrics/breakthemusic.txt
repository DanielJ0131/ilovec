(This kid's gonna break the music)
They tryna pick on me but I'm on another planet, boy
Tryna stop the beats but I'm gonna just keep playing on
It must be hard to live in such frustration
I'll take your mind to another dimension
Hey, I don't even know what I'm doing anymore
Take it as you will, but I know I'm not alone
Every single note I've sung is for you
I got them talking about me like
"This kid's gonna break the music"
And when this melody drowns them out
I'll let them see how nice the view is
From up above
This kid's gonna break the music
I'll let them see how nice the view is
From up above
Don't take it out on me, I ain't listening to your weeping, boy
Tryna cut me off, won't you give it up and sing along?
It takes zeal and determination
This is your last chance at redemption
Hey, I don't even know what I'm doing anymore
Take it as you will, but I know I'm not alone
Every single note I've sung is for you
I got them talking about me like
"This kid's gonna break the music"
And when this melody drowns them out
I'll let them see how nice the view is
From up above
Look at me now
I'm flying high, oh
Ready to touch the stars and make the mine, all
And I remember you trying to hold me down
Saying that I won't even get off the ground
I devote this song to you, whoa
I couldn't have made it without you
And everything that you put me through
I got them talking about me like
"This kid's gonna break the music"
And when this melody drowns them out
I'll let them see how nice the view is
From up above
