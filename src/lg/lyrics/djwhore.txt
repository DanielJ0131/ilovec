Drop the bass
Take this bitch
Y-Y-Yo DJ play a hard bass song
I'll ride your bass line all night long
Give me a beat - Like this
I'll taste the bass that's on my lips
I've got the beats, I've got the bass
I've got the treats, for you to taste
Get your body on the floor
I'll drop the bass you DJ whore
Uh, I like it
Uh, uh, I like it, like it
Yes
Uh, I like it
Uh, uh, I like it, like it
Yes, yes yes
Oh baby baby, I like that
It sends the shivers down my back
Think I'll come and dance with you
Yeah, up behind the DJ booth
No way, bitch, no room for you
You'll only interrupt my groove
Think I know what would be best
Just get on down under the decks
I'm 2 steps ahead of you
O-On my knees infront of you
Swallowed the pill that was on my tongue
And you'll be next, it won't be long
My mix is coming to the high,
Here's the climax, here's the rise
Oh, you got it in my eyes (in my eyes [repeat])
Haha
Uh, I like it
Uh, uh, I like it, like it
Yes
Uh, I like it
Uh, uh, I like it, like it
Yes, yes yes
D-J whore
Take this bitch
D-J whore
D-J whore
Y-Y-Yo DJ play a hard bass song

Give me a beat - like this
I'll taste the bass that's on my lips
I've got the beats, I've got the bass
I've got the treats, for you to taste
Get your body on the floor
I'll drop the bass you DJ whore
Uh, I like it
Uh, uh, I like it, like it
Yes
Uh, I like it
Uh, uh, I like it, like it
Yes, yes yes
Uh, I like it
Uh, uh, I like it, like it
Yes
Uh, I like it
Uh, uh, I like it, like it
Yes, yes yes
Oh, you got it in my eyes (in my eyes [repeat])
