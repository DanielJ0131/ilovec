I don't
Even if the world can see
I don't fit perfectly
I don't
I don't fit perfectly
I don't
I don't care what you think of me
Even if the world can see
I don't fit perfectly
I don't care what you think of me
You tell me that I don't belong
 as time goes on
Even if the world could see
I don't fit perfectly
I don't fit perfectly
I don't care what you think of me
Even if the world could see
I don't fit perfectly
I don't care what you think of me
