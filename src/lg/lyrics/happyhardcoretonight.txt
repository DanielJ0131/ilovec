Happy hardcore tonight.
It's the sound of my life.
Turns my dark into light.
I feel so alive.
I'll dance like nobody's watching me,
And sing like no one's listening.
Life is too short and I am free.
I'm so alive.
Old skool sound with a nu skool twist.
Happy hardcore tonight.
It's the sound of my life.
Turns my dark into light.
I feel so alive.
I'll dance like nobody's watching me,
And sing like no one's listening.
Life is too short and I am free.
I'm so alive.
Old skool sound with a nu skool twist.
Old, old skool sound with a nu skool twist.
Old skool sound with a nu skool twist.
Old skool sound with a nu skool twist.

Old skool
Nu skool
Happy hardcore tonight.
It's the sound of my life.
Turns my dark into light.
I feel so alive.
I'll dance like nobody's watching me,
And sing like no one's listening.
Life is too short and I am free.
I'm so alive.
Old school [x4]
Old skool sound with a nu skool twist.
Old, old skool sound with a nu skool twist.
Old skool sound with a nu skool twist.
Old skool sound with a nu skool twist.
