Anime seems kinda pervy, right?
Not all anime
You filthy, fucking casual noob fag!
Filthy
F-Filthy, fucking casual noob fag!
Filthy fucking casual noob fag!
F-Filthy fucking casual noob fag!
Filthy fucking casual noob fag!
Filthy fucking casual
Filthy fucking casual noob fag!
F-Filthy fucking casual noob fag!
Filthy fucking casual noob (Ahh!)
Dude, chill
As long as the proud tradition of anime is at risk
I'm afraid I can never chill
You see, I was an orphan
I mean, I had parents but they didn't get me
Then one day I rented a VHS copy of Ninja Scroll from a Hollywood Video
It saved me, anime raised me
Now I live only to defend what I love
You did it
You're not a real fan
We just wanted a recommendation
You fucking casual noob fag!
Filthy fucking casual noob fag!
F-Filthy fucking casual noob fag!
You filthy fucking casual noob fag!
Now I get it! Anime is great, it's just the fans that suck
