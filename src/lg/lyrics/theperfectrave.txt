Every day and night I would search for it online
Hoping for the day
That I found the perfect rave
It eluded me
Until one day finally
I was shown the light
I cannot forget that night
Lazers going high
Bass was going low Ohhhhhhhh Ohh ohh ohh ohhhh
Perfect night and day
At the perfect rave
Music was up loud
The good times always flowed
Perfect night and day
At the perfect rave
Lazers going high
Bass was going low
Perfect night and day
At the perfect rave
Music was up loud
The good times always flowed
Perfect night and day
At the perfect rave
Now when I'm at home
Looking at the flyer from
An amazing night
Oh the night that changed my life
Start remembering
Every single little thing
Brings a smile to my face
I will not forget that day
Lazers going high
Bass was going low
Perfect night and day
At the perfect rave
Music was up loud
The good times always flowed
Perfect night and day
At the perfect rave
