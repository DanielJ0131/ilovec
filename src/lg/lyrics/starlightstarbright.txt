I wish upon a star take me there
Oh starlight starbright
First star I see tonight
I'm dreaming wishing
I could be out there
Oh starlight starbright
I wish on that star tonight
Give me what I need
Make my dreams come true
Starlight starbright
First star I see tonight
Take me on the first flight
To this place where
You hear the hard bass
With the lights, sounds
And the systen that pounds
They say I'm too young I can't wait
For this night to come
Til then I sit in my bedroom
Bass going boom max volume
As I listen to this S3RL tune
I dance in my mind
With all my energy
Wishing that my dream
Becomes a reality
Oh starlight starbright
First star I see tonight
I'm dreaming wishing
I could be out there
Oh starlight starbright
I wish on that star tonight
Give me what I need
Make my dreams come true
Starlight starbright
First star I see tonight
Take me back
To the peak of the night
To the heat of the fight
When everything was right
Had my fresh kicks laced up tight
Rippin it up on the dance floor
To the sounds of the rough
Rugged and raw hardcore
Doubld dare me
Trouble care free
Now it's just a memory
That I hold close with all my energy
I wish upon a star take me back
Oh starlight starbright
First star I see tonight
I'm dreaming wishing
I could be out there
Oh starlight starbright
I wish on that star tonight
Give me what I need
Make my dreams come true
