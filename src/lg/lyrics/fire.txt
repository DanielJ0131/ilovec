Even in the coldest winters
You're the one that lets me sleep
Even in the darkest moments
You're the light that I can see
Baby, you're the fire
Ignite the passion in my soul
You are the fire
The shining light that guides me home
You are the fire
You are the spark that gets me high
You are the fire
You are the flame that cannot die
Baby, you're the fire, fire
You're the fire
You're the fire
You're the fire
Baby, you're the fire
Baby, you're the fire
You're the fire
Baby, you're the fire
Ignite the passion in my soul
You are the fire
The shining light that guides me home
You are the fire
You are the spark that gets me high
You are the fire
You are the flame that cannot die
Baby, you're the fire
You're the fire
Baby, you're the fire, fire
You're the fire
You're the fire
You're the fire
Baby, you're the fire
Baby, you're the fire
You're the fire
Baby, you're the fire
Ignite the passion in my soul
You are the fire
The shining light that guides me home
You are the fire
You are the spark that gets me high
You are the fire
You are the flame that cannot die
