When I feel your sweet embrace again
Take me to that special place again
Up high, floating on cloud nine with you
Heaven is when I'm with you, and you are mine, you are mine
(I'm yours
I'm yours)
I'm yours, say you'll never leave me
Hold on, don't ever let me go
Heaven is when I'm with you, and you are mine, you are mine
Your gaze, I will never lose it
No way, you'll ever be alone
Heaven is when I'm with you, and you are mine, you are mine
You are mine
When I feel your sweet embrace again
Take me to that special place again
Up high, floating on cloud nine with you
Heaven is when I'm with you, and you are mine, you are mine
Heaven is when I'm with you, and you are mine, you are mine
So lost, I am missing
Your touch gives my life meaning
Heaven is when I'm with you, and you are mine, you are mine
(Gives my life meaning)
Heaven is when I'm with you, when you are mine, you are mine
You are mine
(Don't ever let me go)
You are mine
You are mine
(You'll never be alone)
When I feel your sweet embrace again
Take me to that special place again
Up high, floating on cloud nine with you
Heaven is when I'm with you, and you are mine, you are mine
