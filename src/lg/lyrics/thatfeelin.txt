Give me the bassline and the treble
Give me the feeling that makes my heart sing loud like
Ooh-ooh-ooh, la-la-la-la, like ooh-ooh-ooh
And when the speakers start to tremble
It makes my hair stand up on the back of my neck like
Ooh-ooh-ooh, la-la-la-la, like ooh-ooh-ooh
That feelin'
That feelin' like
Ooh-ooh-ooh, la-la-la-la, like ooh-ooh-ooh
Let that sound play and let it take control of me
Over and over again
Makes my heart sing loud like
Give me the bassline and the treble
Give me the feeling that makes my heart sing loud like
Ooh-ooh-ooh, la-la-la-la, like ooh-ooh-ooh
And when the speakers start to tremble
It makes my hair stand up on the back of my neck like
Ooh-ooh-ooh, la-la-la-la, like ooh-ooh-ooh
That feelin'
Ooh-ooh-ooh, la-la-la-la, like ooh-ooh-ooh
Let that sound play and let it take control of me
Over and over again
Let that sound play and let it take control of me
Over and over again
That feelin'
Give me the bassline
Give me the bassline
Give me the bass
Give me the bass
Give me the bass
Bass
Bass
Give me the bassline and the treble
Give me the feeling that makes my heart sing loud like
Ooh-ooh-ooh, la-la-la-la, like ooh-ooh-ooh
And when the speakers start to tremble
It makes my hair stand up on the back of my neck like
Ooh-ooh-ooh, la-la-la-la, like ooh-ooh-ooh
That feelin'
