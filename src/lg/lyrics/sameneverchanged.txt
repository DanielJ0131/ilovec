I remember dancing all night to the DJ above
I remember feeling so right with the music I love
Everybody tells me that now it is just not the same
So I turn around and tell them they're insane
Insane
I remember when you said you came for the music
Didn't need the drugs like the one's who abused it
Saying that you only ever came to get down
Down to party to the untz-untz sound
You've faded from the game, 'cause you say it's not the same
But when I take a look around it seems that you're the one who's changed
The difference that you'll find, is that you're jaded in your mind
The rave is still the same, never changed
I remember dancing all night to the DJ above
I remember feeling so right with the music I love
Everybody tells me that now it is just not the same
So I turn around and tell them they're insane
The rave is still the same, never changed (never changed)
I remember dancing all night to the DJ above
I remember feeling so right with the music I love
Everybody tells me that now it is just not the same
So I turn around and tell them they're insane
