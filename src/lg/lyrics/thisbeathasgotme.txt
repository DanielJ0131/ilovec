This beat has got me
This beat has got me
This beat has got me
Bumpin' and jumpin'
It really feels like something
Can't deal with that feeling
Without my body reelin'
The bass makes me shake
To the rhythm that takes me along
This beat has got me
Bumpin' and jumpin'
It really feels like something
Can't deal with that feeling
Without my body reelin'
The bass makes me shake
To the rhythm that takes me along
This beat has got me
This beat has got me
This beat has got me
Bumpin'
Jumpin'
Bumpin' and jumpin'
This beat has got me
Bumpin' and jumpin'
It really feels like something
Can't deal with that feeling
Without my body reelin'
The bass makes me shake
To the rhythm that takes me along
This beat has got me
Bumpin' and jumpin'
It really feels like something
Can't deal with that feeling
Without my body reelin'
The bass makes me shake
To the rhythm that takes me along
This beat has got me
This beat has got me
This beat has got me
This beat has got me
Bumpin' and jumpin'
It really feels like something
Can't deal with that feeling
Without my body reelin'
The bass makes me shake
To the rhythm that takes me along
This beat has got me
Bumpin' and jumpin'
It really feels like something
Can't deal with that feeling
Without my body reelin'
The bass makes me shake
To the rhythm that takes me along
