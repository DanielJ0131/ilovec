All the colors in the sky
Remind me of your pretty eyes
You'll be with me right now
When I look into the sky
I see the clouds and wonder why
I'm not with you right now
Oh be my rainbow girl
Put the colors in my world
And baby you can see
That we were meant to be
You take the shades of gray
And make them fade away
You brighten up my day
Oh baby won't you stay
I'll be your rainbow girl, la da dee da dee da
La da dee da dee da... la da dee da dee da
I'll be your rainbow girl, la da dee da dee da
La da dee da dee da... la da dee da dee da
I'll be your rainbow girl
All the colors in the sky
Remind me of your pretty eyes
You'll be with me right now
When I look into the sky
I see the clouds and wonder why
I'm not with you right now
Oh be my rainbow girl
Put the colors in my world
And baby you can see
That we were meant to be
You take the shades of gray
And make them fade away
You brighten up my day
Oh baby won't you stay
I'll be your rainbow girl, la da dee da dee da
La da dee da dee da... la da dee da dee da
I'll be your rainbow girl, la da dee da dee da
La da dee da dee da... la da dee da dee da
I'll be your rainbow girl
Oh be my rainbow girl
Put the colors in my world
And baby you can see
That we were meant to be
You take the shades of gray
And make them fade away
You brighten up my day
Oh baby won't you stay
I'll be your rainbow girl, la da dee da dee da
La da dee da dee da... la da dee da dee da
I'll be your rainbow girl, la da dee da dee da
La da dee da dee da... la da dee da dee da
I'll be your rainbow girl
