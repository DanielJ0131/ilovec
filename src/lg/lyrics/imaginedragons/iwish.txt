I never called you and now it's too late
To say all the words that I've wanted to say
The doctor said, "Oh, there's a fight up ahead"
I should've been there by your hospital bed
So it rains every day, oh, it rains every day
No, I haven't got the words to say
Oh, how I wish I was a better friend
Before it was too late
I wish that I would've been there in the end
I wish I was a better friend
I wasn't there when you said your goodbye and I
Replay it in my mind 'bout a thousand times
I wasn't there for those rivers you cried
I was always too busy, no, I didn't make the time
So it rains every day, oh, it rains every day
No, I haven't got the words to say
Oh, how I wish I was a better friend
Before it was too late
I wish that I would've been there in the end
I wish I was a better friend
And every day, I wish you were here
Oh, every day I wish
Oh, every minute of every year
Swear I feel you near
Near me
How I wish I was (How I wish) a better friend (Better friend)
Before it was too late
I wish that I would've been there in the end
I wish I was a better friend
