Sometimes, I can get a little
I can get a little lonely
Sometimes, I can get a little
I can get a little lonely
Some nights I get a little lonely
It's even when there's people all around me
Sometimes I get a little anxious
'Cause these pills don't work the way the doctor played it
I'm starting to spin, needles and pins
Right on the brim, hand on a limb, taking it in
Sleep it away, life in a day, no day in a life
Mixing it up, checking it twice
Trying to breathe, starting to seize
Lights camera action and scene
Story of my life
Oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)
I said oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)
I said
Sometimes I smile to keep things easy
I hide in corners, hope that no one sees me
So I'm playin' the role, ridin' the bull, stuck in a hole
Taking a bow, looking so proud
Look at me now talking about pills in my mouth
Under the tongue, isn't it fun?
Trying to breathe, starting to seize
Lights camera action and scene
Story of my life, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)
I said oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)
I said, "Oh, love" (Keep me company, I said, help keep me company)
(I said, I need the company) Have mercy
(I said, I need the company, I said, oh love)
Oh, love, can you please have mercy on me?
(Keep me company, I said, help keep me company)
(I said, I need the company) Can you keep me company?
(I said, I need the company)
L-O-N-E-L-Y am I so lonely?
Oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
(Keep me company, I said, help keep me company, I said)
On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)
(Help keep me company, I said, oh, love)
I said, oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
(Keep me company, I said, help keep me company, I said)
On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)
(Help keep me company, I said, oh, love)
I said, oh love
