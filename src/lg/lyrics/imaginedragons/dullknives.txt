I'm holding my breath
Holding so tight
Nothing is wrong
Nothing is right
I'm in the dark
Looking for light
Won't someone please save my life?
Inside I'm a mess
But I don't let it show
I'm just hanging on
But you'd never know
I smile all day
And cry through the night
Won't someone please save my life?
Is fleeting
Dull knives
Taking my life
A slow burn fire
From the inside
Dull knives
Twisting my spine
They're taking their time, time
'Til I lose my mind
A smoldering flame
Deep in my heart
Barely a sight
It's barely a spark
Holding on through
Every night
Won't someone please save my life?
I'm crying for help
It's such a clich√©
Invisible pain
Is filling each day
I open my mouth
And feed you a lie
Won't someone please save my life?
Is fleeting
No repeating
Dull knives
Taking my life
A slow burn fire
From the inside
Dull knives
Twisting my spine
They're taking their time, time
'Til I lose my mind
Dull knives
Ripping from the inside
Spare me the ride
From the inside
Dull knives
Twisting my spine
They're taking their time, time
'Til I lose my mind
Dull knives
