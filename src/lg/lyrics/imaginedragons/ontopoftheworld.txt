If you love somebody
Better tell them while they're here
'Cause they just may run away from you
You'll never know quite when, well
Then again it just depends on
How long of time is left for you
I've had the highest mountains
I've had the deepest rivers
You can have it all but life keeps moving
Now, take it in but don't look down
'Cause I'm on top of the world, hey
I'm on top of the world, hey
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile, hey
Been holding it in for a while, hey
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
I'm on top of the world
I've tried to cut these corners
Try to take the easy way out
I kept on falling short of something
I could've gave up then
But then again I couldn't have
'Cause I've traveled all this way for something
Now, take it in but don't look down
'Cause I'm on top of the world, hey
I'm on top of the world, hey
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile, hey
Been holding it in for a while, hey
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
I'm on top of the world
Oh-whoa, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-whoa, oh-oh
'Cause I'm on top of the world, hey
I'm on top of the world, hey
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile, hey
Been holding it in for a while, hey
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
And I know it's hard when you're falling down
And it's a long way up when you hit the ground
But get up now, get up, get up now
And I know it's hard when you're falling down
And it's a long way up when you hit the ground
Gut get up now, get up, get up now
'Cause I'm on top of the world, hey
(And I know it's hard when you're falling down)
I'm on top of the world, hey
(And it's a long way up when you hit the ground)
Waiting on this for a while now
(But get up, now, get up)
Paying my dues to the dirt
(Get up, now)
I've been waiting to smile, hey
(And I know it's hard when you're falling down)
Been holding it in for a while, hey
(And it's a long way up when you hit the ground)
Take you with me if I can
(But get up, now, get up)
Been dreaming of this since a child
(Get up, now)
I'm on top of the world
