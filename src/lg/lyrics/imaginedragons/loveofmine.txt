I see it now, you're flying in the fast lane
Don't stop now, you're living for the octane
Not some cry just for the attention
Not some low, hoping for ascension
All my life, trying just to touch you
All my life, looking in the rearview
Take me now, standing with my open
Hands drawn out, praying for an omen
I'm not sure where this is going
I'm not sure what the stars are showing
All my life trying just to touch you
All my life looking in the rearview
Oh, you look so far away
Love of mine, give me attention
Love of mine, make this connection
If I said you were all that I had to live for
Would you run away from me?
Come on now, come a little closer
Don't back down, looking for the closer
Not some try, looking for a mention
Not some lie, broken intervention
All my life, trying just to touch you
All my life, looking in the rearview
Take me now, standing with my open
Hands drawn out, praying for an omen
I'm not sure where this is going
I'm not sure what the stars are showing
All my life trying just to touch you
All my life looking in the rearview
Oh, you look so far away
Love of mine, give me attention
Love of mine, make this connection
If I said you were all that I had to live for
Would you run away from me?
(Please just let me stay)
Love of mine, give me attention
Love of mine, make this connection
If I said you were all that I had to live for
Would you run away from me?
Love of mine, give me attention
Love of mine, make this connection
If I said you were all that I had to live for
Would you run away from me?
(Lo-ove)
(Whoa-oh)
(Lo-ove)
