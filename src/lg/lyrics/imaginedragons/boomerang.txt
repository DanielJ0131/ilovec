How many lies do we have to tell
To keep from saying that I wish you well
How many times said I'm moving on
How many times that false alarm goes off (goes off)
Goes off (Goes off)
I know I'll see you tomorrow
'Cause I'm bad at letting you go, letting you go
Letting you go, letting you go
Moving on, moving on
Moving on, moving on
I'm ready to go, ready to go
I'm ready to throw, ready to throw
You're my boomerang-boomerang
You're my boomerang-boomerang
How many tears do we have to cry?
How many sleepless, lonely nights?
To work it out, is it worth enough?
Should we go ahead or should we turn around?
I know I'll see you tomorrow
'Cause I'm bad at letting you go, letting you go
Letting you go, letting you go
Moving on, moving on
Moving on, moving on
I'm ready to go, ready to go
I'm ready to throw, ready to throw
You're my boomerang-boomerang
You're my boomerang-boomerang
Just because it isn't easy doesn't mean that it is wrong
Everything that we've been working on, working on so long
Ooh, ooh, ooh
You're my boomerang-boomerang
You're my boomerang-boomerang
You're my boomerang-boomerang
You're my boome-boome-boome-rang
Letting you go, letting you go (Boomerang)
Letting you go, letting you go (Boomerang)
Ready to go, moving on (Boomerang)
Ready to go, moving on (Boomerang)
Ready to go, ready to go (Boomerang)
I'm ready to throw, ready to throw
You're my boomerang-boomerang
You're my boomerang-boomerang
Letting you go, letting you go (Boomerang)
Letting you go, letting you go (Boomerang)
Ready to go, moving on (Boomerang)
Ready to go, moving on (Boomerang)
Ready to go, ready to go (Boomerang)
I'm ready to throw, ready to throw
You're my boomerang-boomerang
You're my boomerang-boomerang
