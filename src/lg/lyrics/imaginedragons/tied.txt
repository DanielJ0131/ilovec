All this time I've spent with you
All that we've been through
Still we're holding on
All this time I've spent with you
I am tied to you
You call me up
Just to say
You think we're better off this way
Leaves may fall
Seasons change
Yet we remain
A year away
A year alone
The tears have fall
But we have grown
The sun will rise
The seasons change
And here we are
All this time I've spent with you
All that we've been through
And we're holding on
All this time I've spent with you
Still I am tied to you
I call you up just to say
How much I've thought of you today
The leaves have fall
The seasons change
Yet we remain
A year has passed
Our children grow
And in their eyes
I see your soul
The sun grows bright
The rain has gone
And here we are
All this time I've spent with you
All that we've been through
And still we're holding on
All this time I've spent with you
I am tied to you
Time will heal our hearts but
Were we doomed from the start or
Were we planned in the stars or
Is there any God at all?
Still we're holding on
All this time I've spent with you
All that we've been through
Still we're holding on
All this time I've spent with you
I am tied to you
