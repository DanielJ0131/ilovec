I suppose she's supposed to be exactly what they want her to be
So pretty in pink
Necklace and ring, don't be heard, just be seen
But that's not who I am
She said I can feel, I can feel too much
And I wish they'd go away, go away
'Cause it's crushing me
It's crushing me
Don't you know that you don't have a say and the scarlet "A" on
Your neck so pretty in red, eyes are all dead
What they haven't said gets stuck in your head
The silence is deafening and your heart is bleeding out
But they don't care, no they never cared at all
They never cared at all
That's not who I am
She said I can feel, I can feel too much
And I wish they'd go away, go away
'Cause it's crushing me
It's crushing me
It's crushing me
It's crushing me
She just wants to be free, take it or leave it
Eyes like the sunrise
Colorful rainbow
She said I can feel, I can feel too much
And I wish it'd go away, go away
'Cause they're crushing me
They're crushing me, oh
(I can feel, I can feel too much)
They're crushing me
(I can feel, I can feel too much)
Oh, they're crushing me
(I can feel, I can feel)
Crushing me
Crash down on me
Crash down on me
