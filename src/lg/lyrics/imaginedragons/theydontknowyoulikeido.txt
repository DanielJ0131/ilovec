He was never gonna make it
Every pill he found, he'd take it
Always on the edge of breakdowns
Keepin' it together somehow
Just another cold November
You called me, but I didn't answer
I was so oblivious, now I'm asking for forgiveness
For every single time I failed you
I'm feeling like it's me that killed you
Remembering the time, they jumped you
And I was too scared to help you
Looking back, I can't erase it, guess it's time to face it
You never seemed to know how to let it all go
Don't listen to a single word they say about you
They don't know you like I do
Don't listen to a single word they say about you
They don't know you like I do
Everybody saw you smiling, yeah, you were always good at hiding
You were always asking questions so you wouldn't draw attention
Everyone who used you, they never really knew you
You're always showing up for everybody but yourself
See, I wish I could take it back, change the future and erase the past
Grab the bullet out and pull you back
I promise that I'd save your life like you saved mine
But now it's far too late for that, and all I have is your story left to tell
So let me tell it, let me tell
Don't listen to a single word they say about you
They don't know you like I do
Don't listen to a single word they say about you
They don't know you like I do
