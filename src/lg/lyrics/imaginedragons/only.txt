Oh pretty baby, you're my motivator
Got me changin' my words and my behavior
Pretty lady, you're my operator
Got me dialin' your number just to hear ya
Tell me the things that you want
I give you all that I've got
Open your eyes, then you will see
It's just you and me
Only
Throwin' out the key
Just livin' in a dream
It's just you and me
Only
Listen to you breathe
Just livin' in a dream
It's just you and me
My disaster, you're my only answer
Got me thinkin' that I could be a master
Pretty baby, you're my heavy ocean
Weigh me down and give me your devotion
Tell me the things that you want (You want)
I give you all that I've got (I've got)
Open your eyes, then you will see
It's just you and me
Only
Throwin' out the key
Just livin' in a dream
It's just you and me
Only
Listen to you breathe
Just livin' in a dream
It's just you and me
Take, take me over
Yeah, take me over
I don't wanna wake up
It's just you and me
Take, take me over
Yeah, take me over
I don't wanna wake up
It's just you and me
Dream, dream, dream, dream world
Dream, dream, dream, dream world
(Take, take me over
Yeah, take me over
I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up)
Wake up!
(Only, only)
Listen to you breathe
Just livin' in a dream
It's just you and me
(Only, only)
Only
Throwin' out the key
Just livin' in a dream
It's just you and me
(Dreamworld...)
It's just you and me
(Dreamworld...)
Only
