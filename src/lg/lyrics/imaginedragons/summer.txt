If only for a second
Let me have you
Tell me all your secrets
Let me know you
Paint me all your pictures
Hang them on my wall
Show me all your colors
Show me all
Open up your eyes
Open up your mind
Fall in line with what you're meant to be
Open up your eyes
Open up your mind
Fall in line with what you're meant to be
A fire burns into you
Purifying all
And what I saw was opulence
And that's not for me
That's not for me
That's not for me
Only in summertime
Only in summertime
Things will change with time
Things will change with time
Only in summertime
Open up your eyes
Open up your mind
Fall in line with what you're meant to be
Open up your eyes
Open up your mind
Fall in line with what you're meant to be
Only in summertime
Only in summertime
Things will change with time
Things will change with time
Only in summertime
