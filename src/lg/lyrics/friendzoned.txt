Oh girl, this is agony
I wish you were into me
But no, it's not meant to be
No matter how good I treat you
Oh no, you're with that dick
He treats you like shit
But to me you say
I friendzoned you (you [x6])
I want you here with me whenever I'm sad (sad [x6])
But you'll never get to take me to bed (bed [x6])
Sorry that the feelings aren't mutual (ual [x6])
Take it or leave it 'cause I friendzoned you
(YoÂ¡, drop the bass)
(Bass)
I friendzoned you (you [x6])
I want you here with me whenever I'm sad (but [x6])
But you'll never get to take me to bed (bed [x6])
Sorry that the feelings aren't mutual (ual [x6])
Take it or leave it 'cause I friendzoned you
Yo, here we go
I'm the asshole in her life I give her the "D"
No matter how I treat her she stays with me
We're fighting all the time, 'cause I cheat, I lie
Then it's you on the phone when she's having a cry
You treat her real good, you treat her so nice
But when she gets home, she's back on my pipe
A little advice, to you from me
With girls like these, treat 'em mean keep 'em keen
Bring the beat back
So now, can you see it too?
That this guy's no good for you
Uh... no, won't listen to me
No matter how much you see it
Oh no, you're still with that dick
He treats you like shit
But to me you say
I friendzoned you (you [x6])
I want you here with me whenever I'm sad (but [x6])
But you'll never get to take me to bed (bed [x6])
Sorry that the feelings aren't mutual (ual [x6])
Take it or leave it 'cause I friendzoned you
