Ooh, ooh [4x]
You don't have to be alone when I leave
I'll be watching you like angels do
I'll see you again someday, my friend
And the day will come when you rise above
I'll be right there waiting for you
Together again, like we used to
[2x]
Ooh, ooh
I'll be watching you like angels do
Ooh, ooh
I'll see you again someday, my friend
Ooh, ooh
I'll be right there waiting for you
Ooh, ooh
Together again, like we used to
You don't have to be alone when I leave
I'll be watching you like angels do
I'll see you again someday, my friend
And the day will come when you rise above
I'll be right there waiting for you
Together again, like we used to
[2x]
