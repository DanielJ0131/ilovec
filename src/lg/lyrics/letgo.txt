All I ever need
Is just to hear the beat
And feel it take right over me
And then I really know
To let it all go
I lose myself
You need to let go
Let the music control
Let it take your body, everybody
Let go
Let the music control
All that you know, let it all go
You need to let it go
Let the music control
Let it take you body, everybody
Let go
Let the music control
All that you know, let it all go
When I hear the sound
Vibrating through the ground
Out through the air and all around
It takes me far away
A place I wanna stay
I lose myself
Lose yourself
You need to let go
Let the music control
Let it take your body, everybody
Let go
Let the music control
All that you know, let it all go
You need to let go
Let the music control
Let it take your body, everybody
Let go
Let the music control
All that you know, let it all go
When I hear the sound
Vibrating through the ground
All through the air and all around
It takes me far away
A place I wanna stay
I lose myself
All I ever need
Is just to hear the beat take over me
And then I really know
To let it all go
I lose myself
You need to let go
Let the music control
Let it take your body, everybody
Let go all that you know
Let it all go
Let go
Let go
Let go
When I hear the sound
Vibrating through the ground
All through the air and all around
It takes me far away
A place I wanna stay
I lose myself
Lose yourself
I lose myself
You need to let go
Let the music control
Let it take your body, everybody
Let go
Let the music control
All that you know, let it all go
You need to let go
Let the music control
Let it take your body, everybody
Let go
Let the music control
All that you know, let it all go
