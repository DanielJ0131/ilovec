You're not alone
You've got a friend in this song
You're not alone
Let the sound into your soul
You're not alone
You're not alone
You're not alone
(Not alone, not alone
Not alone, not alone
Not alone, not alone, not alone, not alone
... not alone)
You're not alone
You're not alone
You're not alone
You've got a friend in this song
Standing right next to you
You're not alone
Let the sound into your soul
Music's the best friend you know
You're not alone
(Not alone, not alone
Not alone, not alone
Not alone, not alone, not alone, not alone
... not alone)
You're not alone
You're not alone
