I know our love's forbidden
I know our love can't be
But I cannot help feeling
You're the only one for me
We're like a true love story
Romeo and Juliet
Our two worlds cannot be as one
And it hasn't stopped us yet
When at la-a-a-a-a-a-ast
I'm with you
Our embra-a-a-a-a-a-a-ace
Will shake the room
Finally-y-y-y-y-y-y-y we'll be as one
Like the sou-u-u-u-u-u-u-ulmates
We've become
When at la-a-a-a-a-a-ast
I'm with you
Our embra-a-a-a-a-a-a-ace
Will shake the room
Finally-y-y-y-y-y-y-y we'll be as one
Like the sou-u-u-u-u-u-u-ulmates
We've become
I know we may never get to meet
But I cannot lose hope that
The impossible can be-be-be
So while I'm stuck here
Waiting for the day I want to see
I'll keep on dreaming to myself
And as I do I sing
When at la-a-a-a-a-a-ast
I'm with yo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ou
Finally-y-y-y-y-y-y-y we'll be as one
Like the sou-u-u-u-u-u-u-ulmates
We've become
