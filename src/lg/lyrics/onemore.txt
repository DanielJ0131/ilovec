Your mind is always mine
Just one more game and it'll all be fine
Don't cry, I am here tonight
And when you're back tomorrow I'll be always on time
You and me, we connect better than all your friends
I'll be there when they're gone, you can play what you want
On repeat with your hands on the desk, don't you ever think
About your friends again
You don't need them, there's no reason
I'm your real friend, ah
Never leave home, life is evil
I'm your freedom, oh
One more, one more
Try to resist me, you're gonna miss me
One more, one more
I've got what you're looking for
One more, one more
Try to resist me, you're gonna miss me
One more, one more
I've got what you're looking for
Every time I tried to leave, you went inside my mind
Infesting me with imagery while I'm here tryna get a life
Don't lie about it to yourself, admit the truth 'cause it's enough
To add that fuel of motivation you must surely put in effort
Get energized, don't be a creep like Pennywise
Surround yourself with facts not lies, you might become the next J Dahmer
Lowstattic opened your eyes, expand your knowledge like Adonis
And you will demolish any kind of threat that life be giving you
Patience is a virtue in the form of existence
I'ma hit you with this flow you might think opposite instantly
Just consistency in rhythm games will jump on like anything
One two, one two, there and there, can you keep up with my rapping ability?
Don't leave me behind
Your destiny, our stars aligned
No one else you can find
Can take away what's truly mine
Evermore years on end, our connection deepens
I'm the one you depend, you don't need any friends
You don't need any friends
You don't need them, there's no reason
I'm your real friend, ah
Never leave home, life is evil
I'm your freedom, oh
One more, one more
Try to resist me, you're gonna miss me
One more, one more
I've got what you're looking for
