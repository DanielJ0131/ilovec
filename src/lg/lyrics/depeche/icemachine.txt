Running through my head secretly
The shouts of the boys in the factory
I ring you on the telephone silently
Like blood, like the wine in the darkroom scene
The darkroom scene
Darkroom scene
A letter, once composed
Seven years long and as tall as a tree
Reading on the wall
Emissions, efficiency
Efficiency
Efficiency
Resurrect
As a feeling
On my window
Of a past reunion
Resurrect, as a feeling
On my window of a past reunion
Vision of a picture like the city
And the air we breathe
The air we breathe
Air we breathe
She stood beside me once again
I knew her face
We met before in the street
Recalling all the children dancing at our feet
The dancing feet
Dancing feet
