(Where did you go...)
Where did you go, where did you go
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I don't know where you are, now there's a hole left in my heart
Where did you go, where did you go
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I've searched all over here to there can't find you anywhere
Where did you go...
Where did you go, where did you go
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I don't know where you are, now there's a hole left in my heart
Where did you go, where did you go
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I've searched all over here to there can't find you anywhere
