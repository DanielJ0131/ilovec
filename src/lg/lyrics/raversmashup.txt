Now follow me into the raver dimension
I know this pretty rave girl, always think about her
And when she says hi to me, butterflies go right through me
And when I see her dancin', wanna take a chance in
Getting a little closer and maybe get to know, know, know...
(Yeah, yeah, here we go)
I know this pretty rave girl, always think about her
And when she says hi to me, butterflies go right through me
And when I see her dancin', wanna take a chance in
Getting a little closer and maybe get to know, know, know...
Stomp your feet, keep it going in contention
Part of ascension, throw it into hypertension
It's my invention, come and step at your discretion
It's going in down in the raver dimension
Raise your hands and heartbeat
Be, be my rave boy, we can have some fun
Dancing together till morning sun
My heart is racing if only you knew
I can't imagine my life without you
I can just imagine our cute raver life
Holding hands together under laser lights
Waiting for the build-up so we can lose our minds
If only you knew I want to make you mine
Little kandi raver, she's my number one
And everytime I see her movin' she's always having fun
She's my little kandi raver, see her shake her thing
I love to see her dance and I love to hear her sing
Kandi boy raver, he's the one for me
And when the music starts to play he'll be dancin' to the beat
He's my kandi boy raver movin' with the flow
When he holds me tight don't wanna let him go (Won't let you go)
Dancing together till morning sun
Waiting for the build-up so we can lose our minds
Dreams to lose yourself inside, hidden in the sands of time
More to me than my surprise
I don't feel like I do belong
When he holds me tight don't wanna let him go
Lalalalalalala, lalalalalalala, lalalalalala, yeah yeah yeah
Ya ever wonder where people of the sun get it done
Pack and run, and have a ton of fun
Well it's happy place, rip and shake, journey into outer space
Ticket bought and here we go, spread the love and you will know
As the sun sets, we are waiting
For a night of non-stop Raving
And when the night ends we come together
Wishing we could rave forever
It's a raver dimension
As the sun sets, we are waiting
For a night of non-stop Raving
And when the night ends we come together
Wishing we could rave forever
