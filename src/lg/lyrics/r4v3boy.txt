Be - Be my rave boy
We can have some fun
Dancing together
Till the morning sun
My heart is racing
If only you knew
I can't imagine
My life without you
[2x]
I can't imagine
My life without you
[5x]
I can't imagine
Be - Be my rave boy
We can have some fun
Dancing together
Till the morning sun
My heart is racing
If only you knew
I can't imagine
My life without you
I can just imagine
Our cute raver life
Holding hands together
Under laser lights
Waiting for the build-up
So we can lose our minds
If only you knew I
Want to make you mine
Want to make you mine [repeat]
If only you knew I
Want to make you mine
Be - Be my rave boy
We can have some fun
Dancing together
Till the morning sun
My heart is racing
If only you knew
I can't imagine
My life without you
I can just imagine
Our cute raver life
Holding hands together
Under laser lights
Waiting for the build-up
So we can lose our minds
If only you knew I
Want to make you mine
