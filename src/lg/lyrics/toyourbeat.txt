To your beat, to your beat
To your beat, to your beat
To your beat, to your beat
To your beat, to your beat
You make me deaf to other people's music
You're the only melody I need
Fill my ears with your sweet song
And I will move to your beat
To your, to your beat
To your, to your beat
To your, to your beat
To your, to your beat
You make me deaf to other people's music
You're the only melody I need
Fill my ears with your sweet song
And I will move to your beat
To your beat, to your beat, to your beat, to your beat
To your beat, to your beat, to your beat, to your beat
To your beat, to your beat, to your beat, to your beat
To your beat, to your beat, to your beat
To your beat, to your beat, to your beat, to your beat
To your beat, to your beat, to your beat, to your beat
To your, to your beat
To your, to your beat
To your, to your beat
To your, to your beat
To your, to your beat
To your beat
To your, to your beat
To your, to your beat
You make me deaf to other people's music
You're the only melody I need
Fill my ears with your sweet song
And I will move to your beat
To your beat, to your beat
To your beat, to your beat
To your beat, to your beat
To your beat, to your beat
