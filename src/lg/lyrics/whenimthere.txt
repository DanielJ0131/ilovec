I first spoke to you so long ago
A day I can't forget
Oh the day when we first met
We've never been close enough to touch
But I feel like you know me better than anybody
But now
The world I knew will fade away
Cause today is the turn of the page
And soon all of my dreams
They will come true
They have to
Yes when I'm there with you
Yes when I'm there with you
Yes when I'm there with you
Yes when I'm there...
Yes when I'm there with you
But now
The world I knew will fade away
Cause today is the turn of the page
And soon all of my dreams
They will come true
They have to
Yes when I'm there with you
I can't help be scared
Of what's to come
Will everything change
Or will we still be the same?
Then with just a word you comfort me
Oh with our sweet embrace
All my doubts will dissipate
But now
The world I knew will fade away
Cause today is the turn of the page
And soon all of my dreams
They will come true
They have to
Yes when I'm there with you
