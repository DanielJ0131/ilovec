I've kissed you a hundred million times
I've tasted the tears that I've cried
I held you my beautiful child
And I'll keep your heart in mine
I love you to the moon and back
My little winter bear
I know you know how much that is
'Cause you're already there
I never knew love like this could
Ever possibly exist
I love you to the moon and back
As long as I live
I see you in all of the stars
Shine brightly right into our hearts
I look at the night sky above
And wonder, can you feel my love?
I love you to the moon and back
My little winter bear
I know you know how much that is
'Cause you're already there
I never knew love like this could
Ever possibly exist
I love you to the moon and back
As long as I live
