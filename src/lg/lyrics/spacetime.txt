I'd fly to another dimension
Just to see your face again
I'd travel far across the cosmos
If you were at the other end
I'd dive into the deepest black hole
To slow down time I had with you
The laws of space and time don't matter
I'd break them all to be with you
The laws of space and time don't matter
I'd break them all to be with you
I'd fly to another dimension
Just to see your face again
I'd travel far across the cosmos
If you were at the other end
I'd dive into the deepest black hole
To slow down time I had with you
The laws of space and time don't matter
I'd break them all to be with you
