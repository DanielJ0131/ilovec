Let's do it
I'll be your sexy raver
Don't say maybe
'Cause tonight
I'm gonna make you mine
I'll make your dreams all come true
Like you want to
I can be
Your fantasy tonight
She's the girl of my dreams
All I want and everything I need
So beautiful and so happy
This sexy raver is the one for me
When I see her sing and dance
I can't help the feelings of romance
Fantasizing what we could be
And hoping that one day she'll say to me
I'll be your sexy raver
Don't say maybe
'Cause tonight
I'm gonna make you mine
I'll make your dreams all come true
Like you want to
I can be
Your fantasy tonight
I'll be your sexy raver
Don't say maybe
'Cause tonight
I'm gonna make you mine
I'll make your dreams all come true
Like you want to
I can be
Your fantasy tonight
Let's do it
I'll be your sexy raver
Don't say maybe
'Cause tonight
I'm gonna make you mine
