I like your old tunes better than the newâ€” (Ha!)
I like your old tunes better than the new
Why did you have to change?
Can't you make the same?
Can't you go back to how you used to do?
The music that we love, music that we want
Can't you go back to how you used to do?
The music that we love, music that we want
I like your old tunes better than the new
Why did you have to change?
Can't you make the same?
Can't you go back to how you used to do?
The music that we love, music that we want
Can't you go back to how you used to do?
The music that we love, music that we want
Dude, you keep making the same sounding songs
I mean, I used to like it, but come on, move on
The same sounds, same beats, same BPM
Over and over and over again
Try something different, try something new
I think everyone would like that from you
Once upon a time I could probably like this
You had a fan once, but I've outgrown it
I like your old tu-
Try something different, try something new
I think everyone would like that (no, no)
I like your old tunes better than the new
Why did you have to change?
Can't you make the same?
Can't you go back to how you used to do?
The music that we love, music that we want
Can't you go back to
How you used to do?
The music that we love
Music that we want (want, want, want)
