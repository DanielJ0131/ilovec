Hey!
But
How do you know? 
The philosophy of knowledge, the study of knowing is called Epistemology
Plato famously said that the things we know are things that are true
That we believe and that we have justification for believing
The world is real, right?
Can science or reason ever prove convincingly
That your friends and YouTube videos and your fingers actually exist beyond your mind?
That you don't just live in The Matrix?
No
Yeah, science bitch!
But
How do you know? 
This time I mean functionally, how do you know?
How do you know? (you know? )
Yeah, science bitch!
And as always, thanks for watching
