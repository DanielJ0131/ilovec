Oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Not good enough to leave though
That's what I tell myself
Every time you come right back
It's this again, ahhh
It's this again, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I still feel shaky
Please don't touch me like that
Do you still love me?
Do you still?
Do you still love me?
Do you still?
Anticlimax
It's this again
Ride or die that's how we were
Now things are different
I'm grown, but still I've changed
But you are still the same
Ah ah ah ah
I still feel shaky
Please don't touch me like that
Do you still love me?
Do you still?
Do you still love me?
Do you still?
Anticlimax
It's this again
