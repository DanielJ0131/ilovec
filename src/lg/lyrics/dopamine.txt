I feel it in my body, I feel it in my soul
My neurons start to fire and chemistry explodes
Heart is pumpin', mind is runnin', drivin' me insane
Feel it in my brain
Oh, dopamine
Dopamine
Oh, dopamine
(Dopamine)
The sound is what I'm feeling, the sound is what I know
I hold onto this feelin', I never let it go
It's my high, my love, my life, my every little thing
Makes me wanna say
Oh, dopamine
Dopamine
(Dopamine)
