Come with me as I travel through this
Strange and controversial environment
The rave scene
And our journey begins with the Kandi Raver
I'm a kandi raver
And I'm all about PLUR
Just give me love
And maybe some drugs
And I'll give you hugs
I'm a kandi raver
And I'm all about PLUR
Just give me love
And maybe some drugs
And I'll give you hugs
I'm a kandi raver
Just give me love
And maybe some drugs
And I'll give you hugs
At the opposite end of the spectrum
Bro's are the alphas of the rave scene
Oozing with testosterone and travelling in packs
These relatively new inhabitants
Have certainly made themselves at home
Most couldn't tell you the name of the DJ
You'd have to search far and wide
To find a rave that didn't have at least one of these creatures
Usually found lurking around VIP rooms
Waiting for their next victim
This is the DJ Groupie
I'm with the DJ
He put me on his list
All I had to do was go backstage and suck his
I'm with the DJ
I'm with the DJ
All I had to
Do was suck his
I'm with the DJ
He put me on his list
All I had to do was go backstage and suck his
I'm with the DJ
All I had to
Do was suck his
I'm with the DJ
All I had to
Do was suck his
At the center of raving's controversy
The Dealer is both shunned and beloved
Frequently removed from venues
But always in high demand
I'm your pill provider
Get this shit inside ya
Got what you need
In my magic bag of treats
It's the purest shit
Don't use a testing kit
Best money that you'll spend
Thank you! Come again
I'm your pill provider
Best money that you'll spend
Thank you! Come again
In the circle of life that is the rave scene
The Newbie Raver is the seedling
Infinitely enthusiastic and unjaded
Who knows where this young sapling could end up?
This is the best time of my life
Don't know how I could feel so high
I wish this night would never end
I can't believe that this is real
I can't explain just how I feel
I wish this night would never end
This is the best time of my life
Don't know how I could feel so high
I wish this night would never end
I can't believe that this is real
I can't explain just how I feel
I wish this night would never end
As the sun rises
And security starts kicking everyone out
So ends another chapter
In the world of the ever fascinating
Rave scene
