(You'll never...) [2X]
You'll never, you'll never [4X]
You'll never, you'll never
No matter what you do, it'll end the same
You'll never, you'll never
Everybody knows, we're all playing a game
You'll never, you'll never
No matter what you do, it'll end the same
You'll never, you'll never
You can take the drugs of the ravers
But you'll never take the ravers of the drugs
Come for the music
Come to dance
Stage of dawn
For drug romance
People you see
Are taking E
Once you're here
You'll never leave
You'll never, you'll never
No matter what you do, it'll end the same
You'll never, you'll never
Everybody knows, we're all playing a game
You'll never, you'll never
No matter what you do, it'll end the same
You'll never, you'll never
You can take the drugs of the ravers
But you'll never take the ravers of the drugs
[2X]
You'll never, you'll never...
You'll never, you'll never
No matter what you do, it'll end the same
You'll never, you'll never
Everybody knows, we're all playing a game
You'll never, you'll never
No matter what you do, it'll end the same
You'll never, you'll never
You can take the drugs of the ravers
But you'll never take the ravers of the drugs
Come for the music
Come to dance
Stage of dawn
For drug romance
People you see
Are taking E
Once you're here
You'll never leave
You'll never, you'll never
No matter what you do, it'll end the same
You'll never, you'll never
Everybody knows, we're all playing a game
You'll never, you'll never
No matter what you do, it'll end the same
You'll never, you'll never
You can take the drugs of the ravers
But you'll never take the ravers of the drugs
You'll never, you'll never...
You can take the drugs of the ravers
But you'll never take the ravers of the drugs!
