My BFF will need to prove that they can party
And when this is over I will have found my new BFF
Game on bitches
Molly is a friend of mine. 
She is so pure, she is divine.
Just don't let her get too cut 
When shes cut she is no fun.
B-F-F [x3]
Friends forever.
Lucy is my travel friend
We go on trips to Neverland
Gone for days at a time
Having the time of our lives.
B-F-F [x3]
Friends forever
Charlie is my friend alright
We party party every night 
Hard and fast then shes gone
She never lasts very long
B-F-F
Friends forever
Mary Jane my old friend still
We just like to hang and chill
Take a break relax and eat
Then laugh and laugh til we can't breathe
