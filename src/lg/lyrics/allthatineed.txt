You are all that I need
Nothing you could do could stop me lovin' you
Just please stay with me
I live for you and I'd die for you
You are all that I need
I know you're bad, but I can't stay mad
I'm down on my knees
I'd die for you, if you asked me to
Heya pretty lady!
I can see you're kinda shy
I got something for ya
Some come give me a try
My lovin ain't addictive
Don't let it go to waste
I won't get you hooked
If you only have a taste
We'll ride into the sunset
And then I'll kiss your lips
Come and find me baby
And I will be your fix
You are all that I need
I'd die for you if you asked
You are all that I need
Nothing you could do could stop me lovin' you
Just please stay with me
I live for you and I'd die for you
You are all that I need
I know you're bad, but I can't stay mad
I'm down on my knees
I'd die for you, if you asked me to
[Rings]
Heya old friend
Why ya blowin' up my phone?
You had me last week
But now I wanna be alone
You're screaming out your lungs
Saying I'm all that you need
But can't you see girl?!
I've got other mouths to feed
We don't have a future
Our story is fiction
I can't be
The cure of your addiction
You are all that I need
I'd die for you if you asked, asked, asked...
You are all that I need
Nothing you could do could stop me lovin' you
Just please stay with me
I live for you and I'd die for you
You are all that I need
I know you're bad, but I can't stay mad
I'm down on my knees
I'd die for you, if you asked me to
