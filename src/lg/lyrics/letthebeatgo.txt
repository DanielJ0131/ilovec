Let the beat go
Everybody get on the dancefloor
We're here to party leave your ego at the door
The beat's inside you, it's in your DNA
Now drop that beat, nice and hard, DJ
You know what to do, when you hear the tunes
I bring the noise and the noise comes to get you
You've gotta let go, of all you think you know
Nothing matters so just let beat go
Let the beat go
Let the beat go
You know what to do, when you hear the tunes
I bring the noise and the noise comes to get you
You've gotta let go, of all you think you know
Nothing matters so just let beat go
Everybody get on the dancefloor
We're here to party leave your ego at the door
The beat's inside you, it's in your DNA
Now drop that beat, nice and hard, DJ
You know what to do, when you hear the tunes
I bring the noise and the noise comes to get you
You've gotta let go, of all you think you know
Nothing matters so just let beat go
