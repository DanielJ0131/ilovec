Run
Now that I
Have you by
My side
All the time
I won't
Won't let you go
Ever again
All this I know
You and me
Less than 3
This is how
We're meant to be
I can't live without you in my life
Until now
I always thought I
Could live without you by
My side all the way
And so now
I hold you so close
I'll never let you go
You're my less than three
Now that I
Have you by
My side
All the time
I won't
Won't let you go
Ever again
All this I know
You and me
Less than 3
This is how
We're meant to be
I can't live without you in my life
Until now
I always thought I
Could live without you by
My side all the way
And so now
I hold you so close
I'll never let you go
You're my less than three
Until now
I always thought I
Could live without you by
My side all the way
And so now
I hold you so close
I'll never let you go
You're my less than three
