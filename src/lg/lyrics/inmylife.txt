In my life...
Your face (your face)
Your touch (your touch)
I love you very much (so much)
I hold (I hold)
You tight (you tight)
And squeeze through the night
But when (but when)
You leave (you leave)
All I can do is dream (I dream)
Of when (of when)
We kiss (we kiss)
'Cause you're the one I miss
In my life, I have seen
That there’s nothing close to being
Without you, by my side
'Cause I need you in my life
[2X]
In my life...
In my life, I have seen
That there’s nothing close to being
Without you, by my side
'Cause I need you in my life
[2X]
Your face (your face)
Your touch (your touch)
I love you very much (so much)
I hold (I hold)
You tight (you tight)
And squeeze through the night
But when (but when)
You leave (you leave)
All I can do is dream (I dream)
Of when (of when)
We kiss (we kiss)
'Cause you're the one I miss
In my life...
In my life, I have seen
That there’s nothing close to being
Without you, by my side
'Cause I need you in my life
[2X]
In my life...
