Sky rocket, rocket away
Through the sky, I watch you soar
And if you fly too close to the sun
I'll be there to break your fall
I see you rising high
Ever faster through the sky
Soon you'll touch the stars
You'll have gone so far
If by chance you go too high
Trust in me, I promise
I'll be there to break your fall
To break your fall
Sky rocket, rocket away (rocket away)
Through the sky, I watch you soar (I watch you soar)
And if you fly too close to the sun (fly too close)
I'll be there to break your fall
(Ever faster through the sky
Soon you'll touch the stars)
You'll have gone so far
If by chance you go too high
Trust in me, I promise
I'll be there to break your fall
To break your fall
Sky rocket (rocket away)
Through the sky, I watch you soar (I watch you soar)
And if you fly (I promise)
I'll be there to break your fall
Sky rocket, rocket away (rocket away)
Through the sky, I watch you soar (I watch you soar)
And if you fly too close to the sun (fly too close)
I'll be there to break your fall
