Alive, alive
I feel alive
Like I never have before
Rushing up inside of me
Can't help it, I want more
I feel alive
The passion, thrill and ecstasy
Makes me lose all self-control
And there's nothing stopping me
I feel alive
I feel alive
I feel alive
I can't fight it anymore
Emotions get the best of me
And throw reason out the door
I just can't deny
Never-ending fantasy
Neon sparks and electric hearts
Are my new reality
I feel alive
I feel alive
Oh, alive, alive, alive
I feel alive, I feel alive
I feel alive
I feel alive
I feel alive
I feel alive
I feel alive
Alive, alive, alive
I feel alive
Like I never have before
Rushing up inside of me
Can't help it, I want more
I feel alive
The passion, thrill and ecstasy
Makes me lose all self-control
And there's nothing stopping me
I feel alive
Alive, alive, alive
