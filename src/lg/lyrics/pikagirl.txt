I wish that we were on TV,
just like in pokemon.
You'd be a pika-girl,
In a poke world.
Yes, life would be so fun!
I'd be a trainer boy,
and I would make the choice
to go and search for you.
I'd throw my pokeball
and I would catch them all.
You'd be my Pikachu!
(Pi-Pikachu!)
You're my pika-girl,
in the poke world.
Oh, I won the gym badge,
but you won my heart.
(Pika!)
Pika-girl, in the poke world
And now that I've got you,
we can never part.
(chu!)
The pokeball in my life's open for you.
(Pika!)
You're my pika-girl,
in the poke world.
Just like in pokemon!
(Piiika!)
(Pikachu!)
You're my pika-girl,
in the poke world.
Oh, I won the gym badge,
but you won my heart.
(Pika!)
Pika-girl, in the poke world
And now that I've got you,
we can never part.
(chu!)
The pokeball in my life's open for you.
(Pika!)
You're my pika-girl,
in the poke world.
Just like in pokemon!
(Pika!)
I'd bring you sweets,
like rare candies.
Level up your love to give.
And then you'd use right then,
a sweet kiss TM
(super effective)
Not even the Elite Four could stop us evermore,
together we can't fall.
Our bond would never break,
and there'd be no mistake.
Our love would conquer all!
(Pi-Pikachu!)
You're my pika-girl,
in the poke world.
Oh, I won the gym badge,
but you won my heart.
(Pika!)
Pika-girl, in the poke world
And now that I've got you,
we can never part.
The pokeball in my life's open for you.
(Pika!)
You're my pika-girl,
in the poke world.
Just like in pokemon!
(Piiika!)

but you won my heart.

in the poke world.
Just like in pokemon!
