I am the silicon girl
I am the silicon girl
Every time you look at me you turn me on
Makes me feel like I can live again
The day has just begun
We have the perfect life
You're everything I that I could ever want
I know you feel it too
It's just like I was made to be with you
I am the silicon girl
I was made to be with you
I am the silicon girl
There's nothing I would never do
I am the silicon girl
Anything that I can be
I am the silicon girl
I'm ready to be your fantasy
Power on
One on one
Ready to begin
Let's go!
Silicon
Girl
Let's go!
I am the silicon girl
I am the silicon girl
I am the silicon girl
I am the silicon girl
I am the silicon girl
You will never have to MTC
Again
I am the silicon girl
I am the silicon girl
Let's go!
Silicon
Girl
I am the silicon girl
I am the silicon girl
I am the silicon girl
I am the silicon girl
