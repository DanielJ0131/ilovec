We've been drinking tonight
But we're just getting started
And I've gotta tell you that
We shouldn't be parted
I can already see ya boy
It's gonna be a party 'cause
The lights are all off and
It's just you and me tonight
It started on that dance floor
With the music really loud
Lights are flashing bright
As I'm dancing in the crowd
You walked up and asked to dance
I can't believe you took that chance
Our lips met, and eyes are closed
And this is how our story goes
We've been drinking tonight
But we're just getting started
And I've gotta tell you that
We shouldn't be parted
I can already see ya boy
It's gonna be a party 'cause
The lights are all off and
It's just you and me tonight
I'm falling for you
As I'm falling in your arms
Promise me this is real
And I'm not falling for your charm
Because this feeling makes me shake
And I know you feel it too
Boy it's not the alcohol
I'm in love with you
We've been drinking tonight
But we're just getting started
And I've gotta tell you that
We shouldn't be parted
I can already see ya boy
It's gonna be a party 'cause
The lights are all off and
It's just you and me tonight
We've been drinking tonight
But we're just getting started
And I've gotta tell you that
We shouldn't be parted
I can already see ya boy
It's gonna be a party 'cause
The lights are all off and
It's just you and me tonight
I want you boy
To hold my hand
Whisper in my ears
I want you bad
Sing me those songs
When we're under your sheets
One thing leading to another
Once you kiss me on the cheek
I want you boy
To hold my hand
Whisper in my ears
I want you bad
Sing me those songs
When we're under your sheets
One thing leading to another
Once you kiss me on the cheek
We've been drinking tonight
But we're just getting started
And I've gotta tell you that
We shouldn't be parted
I can already see ya boy
It's gonna be a party 'cause
The lights are all off and
It's just you and me tonight
We've been drinking tonight
But we're just getting started
And I've gotta tell you that
We shouldn't be parted
I can already see ya boy
It's gonna be a party 'cause
The lights are all off and
It's just you and me tonight
We've been drinking tonight
But we're just getting started
And I've gotta tell you that
We shouldn't be parted
I can already see ya boy
It's gonna be a party 'cause
The lights are all off and
It's just you and me tonight
It's just you and me tonight
It's just you and me tonight
