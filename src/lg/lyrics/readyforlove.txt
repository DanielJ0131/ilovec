Take me away.
Back to the magical day.
When I explode everytime that you call out my name.
Shivers inside.
My heart is aching for you.
The earth is in motion. You color my heaven so blue.
My heart is pounding.
I'm losing my mind.
How can I leave all these feeling behind.
I'm hungry for you and I know I need you tonight.
I'm ready for love.
Who needs tomorrow?
Ready for love,
Tonight 
Ready for love.
No more sorrow.
Ready for love.
Tonight.
Vision of you.
You're spirit of love that I feel.
When we're together I know that our passion is real.
Time on our side,
When we make love through the night.
Open my heart and reveal all my secrets inside.
You light up my fire.
I'm burning inside.
How can I run when there's nowhere to hide?
So no it's your turn to decide if you want me tonight.
I'm ready for love.
Who needs tomorrow?
Ready for love,
Tonight.
