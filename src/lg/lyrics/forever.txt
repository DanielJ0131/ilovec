Forever and ever
And ever [x2]
[x2]
I like to go out raving
I like to party hard
And when I'm having all that fun
I wish it would go on
Forever and ever oh
When I'm out there dancing
The DJ spins my song
I lose control of my body
I wish it would go on
Forever and ever oh
I never want this night to end
Here with you, here with my friends
I want this night to last forever
Forever and ever
And ever [x2]
[repeat]
The music's is always pumping
This sound is what I want
So push the bass up to the max
I wish it could go on
Forever and ever oh
Now the sun is rising
And soon it will be dawn
Why does this night have to end?
I wish it could go on
Forever and ever oh
I never want this night to end
Here with you, here with my friends
I want this night to last forever
Forever and ever
And ever [x2]
[repeat]
