Up in the sky
Flying way up high
I can't believe my eyes
A techno feline
So fly
Up high
And never come down
I'll move
Like you
To the techno sound
(Techno Cat)
Techno Kitty Kitty
You're so pretty Kitty
Techno Kitty with a rocket pack
Techno Kitty Kitty
You're so pretty Kitty
Techno Kitty with wings on your back
Flying through the air so high
You're like a shooting star that lights up the sky
Techno Kitty Kitty
You're so pretty Kitty
Techno Kitty Tec-Tec-Techno cat

Techno Kitty Kitty
You're so pretty Kitty
Techno Kitty with a rocket pack
Techno Kitty Kitty
You're so pretty Kitty
Techno Kitty with wings on your back
Flying through the air so high
You're like a shooting star that lights up the sky
Techno Kitty Kitty
You're so pretty Kitty
Techno Kitty Tec-Tec-Techno cat
How?
How?
How'd you get there
Way up in the air
You're soaring so free
Cute fluffy kitty
So fly up high
And never come down
I'll move
Like you
To the techno sound

Techno Kitty Kitty
You're so pretty Kitty
