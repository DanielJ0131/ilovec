And I say hey y'all, hey y'all
Don't be shy, come say hello
So let's go, come dance with me tonight
Everything about the way you move
Paralyzes me, what can I do?
I just wanna dance with you tonight
(Let's go, come dance with me)
When our eyes meet from far away
I wish I was brave enough to say
I just wanna dance with you tonight
And I say hey y'all, hey y'all
Don't be shy, come say hello
So let's go, come dance with me tonight
And I say hey y'all
Hey, hey, hey-hey-hey, hey
