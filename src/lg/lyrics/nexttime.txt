It was just a month ago
Can't forget and won't let go
It's in my mind all the time
I don't know if I will see
The one I never got to meet
I don't know but I can hope
Will I see you again?
At the next cosplay event
And will I recognise you next time?
Our eyes met across the room
We were in matching costumes
Then I knew I just had to meet you
Will we meet again?
I hope so
Will we meet again?
Next Time
Will I see you again?
At the next cosplay event
And will I recognise you next time?
Our eyes met across the room
We were in matching costumes
Then I knew I just had to meet you
I was cosplaying as Chi
There you were as Hideki
Not by chance but destiny
Tried to find you after then
But the day was at an end
Maybe next we'll meet again
Will I see you again?
At the next cosplay event
And will I recognise you next time?
Our eyes met across the room
We were in matching costumes
Then I knew I just had to meet you
