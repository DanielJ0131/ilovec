The hardcore sound
I'm waking up to face another hardcore day
The music's got my soul, and my brain in a sway
I look back on the years gone by since the first rush
Checking out the tunes that got my body in that flush
Everything's clear when the tunes all banging
And the sound's all panning cause Hardcore slamming
Nothing can replace all the feelings that I get
When I'm rushing to a hardcore set
Eternity has passed, it was never gonna last
But we blast with the tracks that were oh so fast
Moving with my tape packs screaming how the hardcore's back
Lost in a melody that's fat
Love for the sound with the four four crown
I slip away and put my tunes on whenever I feel down
One for the haters 'cause your tracks don't pound
I can't imagine life without the hardcore sound!
The hardcore sound
