When the DJ is playing
I close my eyes and I'm raving, baby
All around the world
History in the making
Making, making
History in the making
Making, making
History in the making
When the DJ is playing
I close my eyes and I'm raving, baby
All around the world
History in the making
Making, making
History in the making
Making, making
History in the making
