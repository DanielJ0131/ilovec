I watch pirate movies
Before they have come out
Then pull out my phone
And begin typing down
I'll write about the ending
And all about the plot
Then post to every forum
And on to every blog
Down at the bottom
In tiny tiny words
I'll be sure to announce
Spoiler alert!
Spoiler alert!
Spoiler alert!
Spoiler alert!
When people read my comments
They really lose their minds
Screaming through their keyboards
With threats upon my life
They must think I'd be frightened
And sitting here in fear
But really I'm here smiling
And feeding on their tears
So just to add some insult
To injury and hurt
I tell them "It's your own fault"
Spoiler alert!
Spoiler alert!
Spoiler alert!
