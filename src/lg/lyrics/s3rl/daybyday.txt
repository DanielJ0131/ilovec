Day by day, I see the clouds
Day by day, I see the clouds
Day by day, I see the clouds up above
Day by day, I see the clouds up above
Day by day, I see the clouds up above
Lost in mind
Day by day, I dream to try and synthesize
I'm so high
Day by day, I see the clouds up above
Lost in mind
Day by day, I dream to try and synthesize
I'm so high
Day by day by day
Day by day, I see the clouds up above
Lost in mind
Day by day, I dream to try and synthesize
I'm so high
Day by day, I see the clouds up above
Lost in mind
Day by day, I dream to try and synthesize
I'm so high
Day by day by day
Day by day, I see the clouds up above
Lost in mind
Day by day, I dream to try and synthesize
I'm so high
Day by day, I see the clouds up above
Lost in mind
Day by day, I dream to try and synthesize
I'm so high
Day by day by day
Day by day, I see the clouds up above
Lost in mind
Day by day, I dream to try and synthesize
I'm so high
Day by day, I see the clouds up above
Lost in mind
Day by day, I dream to try and synthesize
I'm so high
Day by day by day
Day by day by day
