Oh the music is my saviour
Oh the music saved my life
Came and took me from the darkness
Swept me up
And brought me to the light
Yeah the music is my saviour
I won't have to say good-bye
And I'll never ever forget
That day
The music saved my life
(Music saved my life, life, life, life, life, life)
The music saved my life, life, life, life
Music's my saviour
kept me from danger
It saved my life
Oh the music is my saviour
Oh the music saved my life
Came and took me from the darkness
Swept me up
And brought me to the light
Yeah the music is my saviour
I won't have to say good-bye
And I'll never ever forget
That day
The music saved my life
(Music's my saviour, savior)
Music's my savior
(Kept me from danger, danger)
Kept me from danger
(It saved my life, it saved my life)
It saved my life
(Music saved my life, life, life, life, life, life)
Oh the music is my saviour
Oh the music saved my life
Came and took me from the darkness
Swept me up
And brought me to the light
Yeah the music is my saviour
I won't have to say good-bye
And I'll never ever forget
That day
The music saved my life
