Every night I look into the Crystal Sky
Every time I see a world of fantasy
I just can't describe
And everyday
Dreaming takes me for away
To a place I know
Never let it go
I will always stay
The Crystal Sky
(Yeah, aayy, ohh)
(Yeah, aayy, ohh)
The Crystal Sky
(Yeah, aayy, ohh)
The Crystal Sky-y-y
The Crystal Sky-y-y
The Crystal Sky
(Yeah, aayy, ohh)
(Yeah, aayy, ohh)
The Crystal Sky
(Yeah, aayy, ohh)
(Yeah, yeah)
The Crystal Sky-y-y
The Crystal Sky-y-y
I'm floating away
I'm going today
Every night I look into the Crystal Sky
Every time I see a world of fantasy
I just can't describe
And everyday
Dreaming takes me for away
To a place I know
Never let it go
I will always stay
The Crystal Sky
(Yeah, aayy, ohh)
(Yeah, aayy, ohh)
The Crystal Sky
(Yeah, aayy, ohh)
The Crystal Sky-y-y
The Crystal Sky-y-y
The Crystal Sky
(Yeah, aayy, ohh)
(Yeah, aayy, ohh)
The Crystal Sky
(Yeah, aayy, ohh)
(Yeah, yeah)
The Crystal Sky-y-y
The Crystal Sky-y-y
I'm floating away
I'm going today
