I got this feeling
That you're stealing
My heart away
And though it feels good
I know I should
Just chase you away
But when the sun's down
And the moon's out
My defenses is wain
And like a shadow
Through my window
You steal it again
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
There's a heart thief at large
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
They stole my Heart
They stole my Heart
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
There's a heart thief at large
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
They stole my Heart
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
There's a heart thief at large
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
They stole my Heart
La la la
La la la
I got this feeling
That you're stealing
My heart away
And though it feels good
I know I should
Just chase you away
But when the sun's down
And the moon's out
My defenses is wain
And like a shadow
Through my window
You steal it again
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
There's a heart thief at large
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
They stole my Heart
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
There's a heart thief at large
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
They stole my Heart
