When your days turn to dark like night
The spark is gone that was once alight
And you feel there's no end in sight
Just remember
When they bring you down
Drag you through the ground
I can pick you up
Yeah, I will pick you up
And when they make you fall
Can't take it no more
I can pick you up
Yeah, I will pick you up
Oh I will pick you up
From the ground when the music plays (Up)
Take your mind to another place (Up)
Make your problems seem to disappear (Up)
Help you free yourself from your fears (Up)
Let the sound light the fire inside (Up)
Start to fly, wave the ground good bye (Up)
Hold this feeling and don't let go (Up)
When I drop the beat the whole crowd goes (Ohh)
(Up...)
When they bring you down
Drag you through the ground
I can pick you up
Yeah, I will pick you up
And when they make you fall
Can't take it no more
I can pick you up
Yeah, I will pick you up
Oh I will pick you up
I will pick you up-
From the ground when the music plays (Up)
Take your mind to another place (Up)
Make your problems seem to disappear (Up)
Help you free yourself from your fears (Up)
Let the sound light the fire inside (Up)
Start to fly, wave the ground good bye (Up)
Hold this feeling and don't let go (Up)
When I drop the beat the whole crowd goes (Ohh)
(Up...)
When your days turn to dark like night
The spark is gone that was once alight
And you feel there's no end in sight
Just remember
When they bring you down
Drag you through the ground
I can pick you up
Yeah, I will pick you up
And when they make you fall
Can't take it no more
I can pick you up
Yeah, I will pick you up
Oh I will pick you up
(Up...)
The whole crowd goes (Ohh)
