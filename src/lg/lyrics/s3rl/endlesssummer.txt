La-dee-da-dee-dee, la-dee-da-dee-do
Seasons come and go, with the wind and snow
La-dee-da-dee-dee, la-dee-da-dee-do
Then an endless summer
Remember all these moments
This is our time together
Just feel the energy
And live this paradise forever
Was like the game we played
And a scene from a great movie
So can we freeze the frame
And just keep dancing to this music?
La-dee-da-dee-dee, la-dee-da-dee-do
Seasons come and go, with the wind and snow
La-dee-da-dee-dee, la-dee-da-dee-do
Then an endless summer
La-dee-da-dee-dee, la-dee-da-dee-do
Stories carry on, everybody knows
La-dee-da-dee-dee, la-dee-da-dee-do
Then an endless summer
It's an endless summer
With boys and girls together
Coming to this party
And going to rave until forever
Was like a game we played
Or a scene from a great movie
Can we freeze the frame
And just keep dancing to this music?
La-dee-da-dee-dee, la-dee-da-dee-do
Seasons come and go, with the wind and snow
La-dee-da-dee-dee, la-dee-da-dee-do
Then an endless summer
La-dee-da-dee-dee, la-dee-da-dee-do
Stories carry on, everybody knows
La-dee-da-dee-dee, la-dee-da-dee-do
Then an endless summer
Come, join the crowd
Next to me, go up and down
Just feel the sound
You're the king, you wear the crown
Come, then the
Come, then the
Come, then the
Come, then the
Come, come, come, come...
Up and down
La-dee-da-dee-dee, la-dee-da-dee-do
Seasons come and go, with the wind and snow
La-dee-da-dee-dee, la-dee-da-dee-do
Then an endless summer
La-dee-da-dee-dee, la-dee-da-dee-do
Stories carry on, everybody knows
La-dee-da-dee-dee, la-dee-da-dee-do
Then an endless summer
