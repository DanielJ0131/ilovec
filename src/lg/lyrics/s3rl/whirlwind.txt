I'm like a whirlwind
I'll put you in a spin
I'll take your breath away
If you can ride this wave
I'll lift you off the ground
Spinning around and round
If you can just hold on
On through this little storm
Things are gonna get better
Sunlights shines through the weather
The clouds will soon have to go
To leave a shiny rainbow
If you can hold on longer
We'll keep on getting stronger
I'm like a whirlwind
I'm like a whirlwind
I'm like a whirlwind
I'm like a whirlwind
I'm like a whirlwind
I'm like a whirlwind
I'm like a whirlwind
I know this might be hard
But this is just the start
This just the start
Things are gonna get better
Sunlights shines through the weather
The clouds will soon have to go
To leave a shiny rainbow
If you can hold on longer
We'll keep on getting stronger
I'm like a whirlwind
I'm like a whirlwind
(Like a whirlwind)
I'm like a whirlwind
I'm like a whirlwind
I'm like a whirlwind
