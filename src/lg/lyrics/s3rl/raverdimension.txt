Raver dimension, ra-raver dimension
Raver dimension, raver dime-mension
Raver dimension, ra-raver dimension
Yeah, yeah, here we go (here we go)
Emcee M. (Emcee M.)
S, 3, R, L
Bringin' it to ya man
Yeah
We handle numatical music for cannibals
Chantin movements of radical, tackle moods are symbatical
Youth are rooting dramatical, toss and lose an emphatical
Reminiscent and wreckin the globe and eat ya like Hannibal
Potent remedy porous and single handily
Handed the people my verbal lighting insanity
S.3.R.L. Yeah, he's always backing me
Atmospheric masterpiece, raise hands and heart beats
I don't feel like I do belong, I'm from the wrong dimension
I wish I could fly away, it's a raver dimension
To, to another galaxy where a new life waits for me
It's the place where I would stay, it's a raver dimension
Stomp your feet, keep it going in contention
Part of ascension, throw it into hypertension
It's my invention, come and step at your discretion
It's going in down raver dimension
I don't feel like I do belong, I'm from the wrong dimension
I wish I could fly away, it's a raver dimension
To, to another galaxy where a new life waits for me
It's the place where I would stay, it's a raver dimension
Ya ever wonder where people of the sun get it done
Pack and run, and have a ton of fun
Well it's happy place, rip and shake, journey into outer space
Ticket bought and here we go, spread the love and you will know
The ravers in the glow, roll it up and keep it low
This is where we wanna go, pass moon around the bow
Follow me and you will see, twist and press reality
Jumpin', jammin' on the rings of the galaxy
I don't feel like I do belong, I'm from the wrong dimension
I wish I could fly away, it's a raver dimension
To, to another galaxy where a new life waits for me
It's the place where I would stay, it's a raver dimension
Dreams to lose yourself inside, hidden in the sands of time
More to me than my surprise, I can see it in your eyes
Lift ya to the sky and your makin' distention
Follow me into the raver dimension
Never in question
Coming at ya, never dimensions
One more time
It's a raver dimension
I don't feel like I do belong, I'm from the wrong dimension
I wish I could fly away, it's a raver dimension
To, to another galaxy where a new life waits for me
It's the place where I would stay, it's a raver dimension
