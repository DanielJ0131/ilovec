Notice me, queen
Come (come)
Come into my dream
I am everything you need
I will do, do it all for you
Hear my siren song call out
Please, queen, notice me
I'm your only fan, you see
Whose heart is held so captive by your scream (Oh)
You thrilled me like a fish
You grant my every wish
The melody of your song sounds so sweet
Notice me, queen
Notice me, queen
Notice me, queen!
Come into my dream
Notice me, queen (Oh)
Everything you need
Come (come)
Come into my dream
I am everything you need
I will do, do it all for you
Hear my siren song call out
Please, please, please, please, please, queen, notice me
I'm your only fan, you see
I'll follow you wherever winds may blow
You can count on me
To be there, breathily
To fight, to watch whatever you may show (Come closer)
Notice me, queen
Notice me, queen
Notice me, queen!
Come into my dream
Notice me, queen (Oh)
Everything you need
Come, come into my dream
I am everything you need
I will do, do it all for you
Hear my siren song call out
