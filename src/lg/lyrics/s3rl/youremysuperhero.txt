Up in the sky, look!
It's a bird!
It's a plane!
You're my superhero
I can be your Louis Lane
I can be your Mary Jane
If you were the Joker
I can be you Harley Quinn
I'll be the one for you
You're my superhero (superhero)
We can take it slowly, nice and easy
We can go fast like it might not last long
I can be the one for you
You're my superhero (superhero)
You're my superhero
I can be your Pepper Potts
I can be your Betty Ross
And if you were Batman
I could even be Robin
I'll be the one for you
You're my superhero (superhero)
We can take it slowly, nice and easy
We can go fast like it might not last long
I'll be the one for you
You're my superhero (superhero)
Superhero
I can be your Louis Lane
I can be your Mary Jane
If you were the Joker
I can be your Harley Quinn
I'll be the one for you
You're my superhero (superhero)
I can be your Pepper Potts
I can be your Betty Ross
And if you were Batman
I could even be Robin
I'll be the one for you
You're my superhero
