I got the sensation, need some elevation
I, EDM master, make it go faster
I just wanna get high, don't wanna go low, too slow, no
Elevate the flow (jump)
Elevate the flow (go)
We don't even care, put them hands up in the air
What you want, what you need, 'cause tonight is all I need
I wish I was a little bit of smarter but I'm not
Turn it up, turn it up, we go rocking round the clock
I got the sensation, need some elevation
I, EDM master, make it go faster
I just wanna get high, don't wanna go low, too slow, no
Elevate the flow
Faster, faster
Faster, faster
Faster, faster
Make it go faster
I just wanna get high
I just wanna get high
I just wanna get high
I just want, just want, just want, just want
I just wanna get high, don't wanna go low, too slow, no
Elevate the flow
Faster, faster
Elevate the flow
I just wanna get high, don't wanna go low, too slow, no
Elevate the flow
