Now that I've found you
Promise me this is forever
And that I can be
Sure that this truly is true
Cause if I'm dreamin'
I'm not ready to wake up yet
So can you hold me
Tight like you'll never let go
Now that I've found you
Promise me this is forever
And that I can be
Sure that this truly is true
Cause if I'm dreamin'
I'm not ready to wake up yet
So can you hold me
Tight like you'll never let go
Now that I've found you
Don't leave again
I couldn't bare to
Part with you my friend
Won't you please
Never leave me
Do everything you can
So that I can be
With you til the end
Now that I've found you
Promise me this is forever
And that I can be
Sure that this truly is true
Cause if I'm dreamin'
I'm not ready to wake up yet
So can you hold me
Tight like you'll never let go
