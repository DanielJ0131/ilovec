We have been through so much
We have been through thick and thin
But but but
This time it just feels like
There is no way we can win
It's the like the whole world's against us
And we cannot find our way
Then you turn to me and say...
We can beat
All the odds
Trust in me because
I will not let you fall
We can beat
All the odds
Trust in me because
I will not let you fall
We can beat all the odds
We have been fighting for so long
Hope we're getting close
It it it
It seems like this is endless
It seems like time has slowed
It's the like the whole world's against us
And we cannot find our way
Then you turn to me and say...
We can beat
All the odds
Trust in me because
I will not let you fall
We can beat
All the odds
Trust in me because
I will not let you fall
We can beat all the odds...
We can beat
All the odds
Trust in me because
I will not let you fall
