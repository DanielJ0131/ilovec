Kicks tied tight 'cause we're going all night
Howling to the moon till the morning time
Don't let go of me, yeah, we feel so right
Never get enough of your moonlit eyes
I can't be without you
I can't be without you
We're gon' run this town tonight
Baby, you and I
I can't be without you
I can't be without you
We're gon' run this town tonight
Baby, you and I
I can't be without you
I can't be without you
We're gon' run this town tonight
Baby, you and I
I can't be without you
I can't be without you
We're gon' run this town tonight
Baby, you and I
