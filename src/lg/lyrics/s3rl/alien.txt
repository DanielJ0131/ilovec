When are you going to land?
Got our heads stuck in the sand
Alien, oh alien

(W-w-w-where you been at, been at?)
(Where you, where you been at?)
(W-w-w-where you been at, been at?)
Been at, been at, been at, been at...
Majestic 12

Where you been at?
Been at, been at, been at, been at

We need help to understand
Who we are and where we stand
Alien, oh alien
Hey

Been at, been at, been at, been at, been at, been at
Where you been at?
Been at, been at, been at, been at, been at, been at
Where you been at?
Alien, oh alien
Where you been at?
Alien, alien
We need help to understand
Who we are and where we stand
Alien, oh alien
