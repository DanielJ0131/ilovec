"Hello? Is, is anybody there? I'm so lonely..."
Through the years and far away
Far beyond the milky way
See the shine that never blinks
The shine that never fades
Through the years and far away
Far beyond the milky way
See the shine that never blinks
The shine that never fades
Hello little star
Are you doing fine?
I'm lonely as
Everything in birth
If I could fly
across this night
faster than the speed of light
I would spread these wings of mine
Through the years and far away
Far beyond the milky way
See the shine that never blinks
The shine that never fades
"You have no messages"
