Just got home from work, I was knackered, I'd had it
But now the weekend was back and I had to attack it
There was just one fact unchecked that really mattered
To meet up with a lad at the back of the Macca's
I was strapping down the back streets in the Mazda through traffic
To get my happy in a snappy that I wanted, he had it
TNS and a bumbag with a mullet to match it
He said, "Nice doing business at the back of the Macca's"
Nice
Back of the Macca's, esh
Nice
I was heading to the rave, I was smacking, I'd hit it
Now the gears coming on, feeling good, I'll admit it
There was just one thing missing, I really needed
To meet up with the boys, make some noise, and get on it
I was hakking like an athlete to the beat in my Maxies
Guy comes up to me, he wants a taste of my magic
I say mate you're too late the boys have fucking smashed it
Pay a visit to the lad at the back of the Macca's
TNS and a bumbag with a mullet to match it
He said, "Nice doing business at the back of the Macca's"
Back, back, back, back
Back of the Macca's
Back, back, back, back
Back of the Macca's
TNS and a bumbag with a mullet to match it
He said, "Nice doing business at the back of the Macca's"
Nice
Esh
Back, back, back, back
Back of the Macca's, esh
