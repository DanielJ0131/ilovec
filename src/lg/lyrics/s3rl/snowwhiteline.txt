Cocaine, on my brain
Playing me just like a game
White line, on my mind
Taking up all of my time
I'm addicted, and conflicted
'Cause I just wish I could kick it
Need a hit, just a bit
Of the magic disco shit
As I breathe the snow white line
As it races through my mind
I grow wings and I can fly
I dance on the clouds up high
As I breathe the snow-white line
I leave all my cares behind
Now I'm feeling so alive
As I breathe the snow white line
