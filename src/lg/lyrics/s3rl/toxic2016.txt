We are Toxic
There is no escape
From our poison
Running through your veins
First you will resist
But then you will see
This is the poison
Of your fantasies
We are Toxic
There is no escape
From our poison
Running through your veins
First you will resist
But then you will see
This is the poison
Of your fantasies
We are Toxic
There is no escape
From our poison
Running through your veins
First you will resist
But then you will see
This is the poison
Of your fantasies
We are Toxic
There is no escape
From our poison
Running through your veins
First you will resist
But then you will see
This is the poison
Of your fantasies
Soon you'll be so high
You cannot come down
Losing your head
Spinning round and around
You'll be addicted
Once you take a hit
Welcome aboard, oh
Welcome to Toxic
We are Toxic
There is no escape
From our poison
Running through your veins
First you will resist
But then you will see
This is the poison
Of your fantasies
Soon you'll be so high
You cannot come down
Losing your head
Spinning round and around
You'll be addicted
Once you take a hit
Welcome aboard, oh
Welcome to Toxic
