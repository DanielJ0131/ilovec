I know
No matter where you are
No matter near or far
You'll be my shining star
I know
That even when I'm low
You'll never let me go
Hold my tight and keep me close
You always know what I need
You pick me right up off of my feet
Spin me round and round the floor
To all my favorite hardcore
Dance more
You always know what I need
You pick me right up off of my feet
Spin me round and round the floor
To all my favorite hardcore
Hardcore
Hardcore
Hardcore
Dance more
You always know what I need
You pick me right up off of my feet
Spin me round and round the floor
To all my favorite hardcore
Dance more
