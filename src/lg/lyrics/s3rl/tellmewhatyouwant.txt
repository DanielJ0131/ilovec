Tell me what you want boy
Cos I've got what you need boy
Just what you're looking for
Tell me what you want
You know it's what I've got
I can be a good girl
Oh I can be your bad girl
Let me into your world
And I can be your dream
Your real life fantasy
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want boy
Cos I've got what you need boy
Just what you're looking for
Tell me what you want
You know it's what I've got
I can be a good girl
Oh I can be your bad girl
Let me into your world
And I can be your dream
Your real life fantasy
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want boy
Cos I've got what you need boy
Just what you're looking for
Tell me what you want
You know it's what I've got
I can be a good girl
Oh I can be your bad girl
Let me into your world
And I can be your dream
Your real life fantasy
