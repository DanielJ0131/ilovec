The night was young
the music played
the atmosphere
intoxicates
as people move
and lasers dance
I saw you there
with just a glance.
Through the dark
I met your gaze
I remember 
like yesterday
for in that time 
a song did play
that will remind
me of that day
Whenever I hear that song I get nostalgic
Cause it played the first time I laid eyes on you
And if that song comes on I don't fight it
I turn it up and dance the whole way through
I get nostalgic-ic-ic-ic-ic-ic-ic...
Whenever I hear that song I get nostalgic
Cause it played the first time I laid eyes on you
And if that song comes on I don't fight it
I turn it up and dance the whole way through
I get nostalgic
whole way through
I get nostalgic
whole way through
