Baby I can feel it
Feel feel it in my soul
When I am round you
I can't help
But lose control
It makes me move my body
Move move to the beat
It makes my body
Shake around
Just like this
Baby I can feel it
Feel feel it in my soul
When I am round you
I can't help
But lose control
It makes me move my body
Move move to the beat
It makes my body
Shake around
Just like this
Just just like this
Baby I can feel it
Feel feel it in my soul
When I am round you
I can't help
But lose control
It makes me move my body
Move move to the beat
It makes my body
Shake around
Just like this
