Little kandi raver
She's my number one
And everytime I see her moving
She's always having fun
She's my little kandi raver
See her shake her thing
I love to see her dance
And I love to hear her sing
Kandi boy raver
He's the one for me
And when the music starts to play
He'll be dancing to the beat
He's my kandi boy raver
Moving with the flow
When when he holds me tight
Don't wanna let him go

Won't let you go
Don't let me go, oh
