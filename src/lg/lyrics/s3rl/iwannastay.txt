I wanna stay
All night
When the music plays, my problems fade away
Stop time cos never wanna leave
Can I stay all night
So I can put myself under a magic spell
Sky-high I never wanna leave
I wanna stay
I wanna stay
I wanna stay
All night
When the music plays my problems fade away
Stop time cos I never wanna leave
Can I stay all night
So I can put myself under magic spell
Sky-high I never wanna leave
I wanna stay
I wanna stay
I wanna stay
All night
I wanna stay
All night
When the music plays, my problems fade away
Stop time cos I never wanna leave
Can I stay all night
So I can put myself under magic spell
Sky-high I never wanna leave
All night
All night
All night
I wanna stay
Can I stay all night
So I can put myself under magic spell
Sky-high I never wanna leave
