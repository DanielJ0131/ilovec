When I'm bored at home and I'm on the Internet
I'm searching for my favourite songs to listen next
But all I see on the screen is Nightcore's
It sort of sounds the same but it just isn't quite right
It sounds like it's sped up and the pitch is up too high
What have they done to my song, tell me why?
Welcome to Nightcore
Nightcore 
Nightcore this song for me now
Nightcore 
Nightcore this if you know how
I'll show you how
This is how to Nightcore
Listen up
And I'll tell you all
Step 1: Take the pitch control
Push it up
And that's basically it
(Nightco-o-o-)
Nightcore this!
Nightcore 
Nightcore this song for me now
Nightcore 
Nightcore this if you know how
Now when I'm looking for my songs on the Internet
I'm searching for the Nightcore's
'Cause now they're my favourite
I can't believe now I think they're the best
I like them 'cause they're faster
I like them 'cause they're high
I like the chipmunk voices, they always make me smile
And now I know why they go making Nightcore
And when this part gets Nightcore'd
It almost sounds normal
But what's the point at all?
(Nightcore )
Nightcore this!
Nightcore 
Nightcore this song for me now
Nightcore 
Nightcore this if you know how
